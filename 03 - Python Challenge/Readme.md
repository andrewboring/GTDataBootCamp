## Note to TA/Instructor:

I have a single repo for all homework to avoid cluttering up my github account since  I keep other projects there as well.
 The instructions for Python homework indicate creating a new repo, but i just created another folder for the challenge.

If I need to shift this to its own repo for some reason (eg, we'll create a branch and add more content in a later assignment), let me know and i'll do it.
